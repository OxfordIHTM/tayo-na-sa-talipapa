This repository contains detailed description on **Tayo na sa talipapa
(Let us go to the market)** game used as a teaching aid for topics on
**Development and Nutrition** and **Developent and Health** of the
**International Development and Health** module of the [MSc in
International Health and Tropical Medicine]().

This repository aims to provide as much information as possible to allow
anyone to facilitate the game in their own context.

## About the game

**Tayo na sa talipapa / Let us go to the market** is a game that can be
used to provide a foundational concept of the state of current
market-based structures within a country, between countries, or
globally. The game has its origins in the Philippines where it has been
used as a method to introduce the topic of structural injustice to new
members of various social movements.

## Mechanics of the game

1.  Each participant are given goods in the form of picture cards with
    corresponding point-values.

2.  The players are grouped into three hierarchical categories defined
    by their initial point totals.

3.  Players are to act like traders trying to barter surplus goods among
    themselves in exchange for goods they need, thereby increasing their
    individual total points. As in any normal market situation, each
    should try to profit from exchange by garnering as many points as
    possible.

4.  Bonus points are given to persons who acquire three or more of a
    kind.

### Game kit

1.  Color coded envelopes representing three (3) groups dependent on
    point values: *Taga-bayan* (well-to-do); *Taga-baryo* (average);
    *Taga-bundok* (poor). Any other relevant names to the
    groupings/categories can be used that would be most appropriate to
    the audience and to the context.

2.  Each envelope contains cards representing commodities with
    corresponding point values. Plan to use 5-6 commodities that are
    appropriate for the context. In the Philippines context, the
    following goods/commodities are commonly used for this game with
    their corresponding point values:

| **Goods**  | **Points** |
| :--------- | ---------: |
| fruits     |          5 |
| vegetables |         10 |
| fish       |         15 |
| chicken    |         20 |
| pig / goat |         30 |
| cattle     |         75 |

3.  Extra card commodities which are to be introduced into the market
    later on in the game.

### Bonus points

The following combination of goods will provide the corresponding bonus
points:

| **Combination** | **Additional points** |
| :-------------- | --------------------: |
| three of a kind |                     5 |
| four of a kind  |                    10 |
| five of a kind  |                    15 |

### Preparation

  - Distribute the envelopes to the participants.
  - Without making participants reveal their goods to each other, ask
    participants to tally their points and be categorised into
    subgroups.
  - Post the names of the participants and their starting totals on the
    board under their predetermined categories.
  - Ask participants to group together accordingly.

## General Rules

It is important to explain some rules before trading time.

1.  Trading can be done with anybody, but only at a given time which
    lasts for about 2 minutes.

2.  Trading done outside the given time will mean confiscation of goods.

3.  Only one-on-one trading is allowed.

4.  An on-going transaction is signified by the two parties locking
    arms.

5.  Trading partners must agree verbally on trading conditions.

6.  Only when they have agreed can they unlock arms.

7.  Refusal to trade is signified by crossing the arms.

## Starting Play

  - The main facilitator invites the participants to trade by saying:
    “Tayo na sa talipapa\!” Participants then commence trading among
    themselves. The main facilitator warns off and announces the end of
    the trading session.

  - After the trading session, participants go back to their groups and
    report their points to their respective facilitators who record
    these on the board.

  - The facilitators distribute 3 of the highest point commodity/asset
    to each group. The members of each group decide how the these
    additional items will be distributed.

  - When the bakas have been distributed, the new points will be
    reported. The facilitator changes the groupings according to the new
    points.

  - The top `n` (to be determined based on the number of participants)
    traders who got the highest scores will now become the *taga-bayans*
    or any other appropriate label for this category. Their ceiling and
    floor scores will be used as range for their categories.

  - The next `n` (to be determined based on the number of participants)
    highest scorers will be the *taga-baryos* or any other appropriate
    label for this category. Again ceiling and scores will determine
    range of their class. The rest will be the *taga-bundoks* or any
    other appropriate label for this category.

  - The facilitator grants the taga-bayans the power to amend or make
    new rules of trading. The other groups must abide by the rules set
    by them.

  - Thereafter, score assessment and re-classification will be done
    after every trading time. The group with the highest scores is given
    the power to change the rules after each trading.

  - The number of trading sessions will depend on the dynamics of the
    group.

## Processing

1.  The following guide questions may be used for discussions and
    processing:
    
    1.  What were your significant experiences during the trading
        sessions? How did you feel? Why?
    
    2.  Do you see patterns regarding the following aspects in the game
        
          - Distribution of goods/grouping of people
          - Mobility between social groupings
          - Decision-making power in setting rules
    
    3.  What parallels with the actual Philippine situation can you draw
        from the game?

2.  The participants are divided into small groups for sharing and
    discussion.

3.  A representative from each group reports the main points in their
    discussion.

4.  The facilitator synthesizes all the group reports.
