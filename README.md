## About the game

**Tayo na sa talipapa / Let us go to the market** is a game that can be used to provide a foundational concept of the state of current market-based structures within a country, between countries, or globally. The game has its origins in the Philippines where it has been used as a method to introduce the topic of structural injustice to new members of various social movements.

## Mechanics of the game

1. Each participant are given goods in the form of picture cards with corresponding point-values.

2. The players are grouped into three hierarchical categories defined by their initial point totals.

3. Players are to act like traders trying to barter surplus goods among themselves in exchange for goods they need, thereby increasing their individual total points. As in any normal market situation, each should try to profit from exchange by garnering as many points as possible.

4. Bonus points are given to persons who acquire three or more of a kind.

### Game kit

1. Color coded envelopes representing three (3) groups dependent on point values: *Taga-bayan* (well-to-do); *Taga-baryo* (average); *Taga-bundok* (poor).

2. Each envelope contains cards representing commodities with corresponding point values. Plan to use 5-6 commodities that are appropriate for the context. In the Philippines context, the following goods/commodities are commonly used for this game with their corresponding point values:

**Goods** | **Points**
:--- | ---:
fruits | 5
vegetables | 10
fish | 15
chicken | 20
pig / goat | 30
